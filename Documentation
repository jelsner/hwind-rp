Task 1: Create a model that outlines areas of hurricane threat, impact, and cleanup by date. Modeled data will be merged with health outcome data at the individual level

1. Get and import the IBTraCS data
2. Keep only hurricanes (USA_WIND >= 64) between 1981 and 2022
3. Compute summary statistics: Average radius to fastest wind (RMW) 43.8 km, average eye diameter 34.5 km, and average radius to outer closed isobar 410 km
4. Fill in missing RMW values. Start with pedigree, then use minimum pressure, then pedigree again
5. Add a distance buffer to the tracks using the RMW as the distance to make segmented swaths
6. Keep only seqmented swaths that intersect Florida
7. Extract the boundaries of storm impacts and add threat and cleanup dates. Unionize the swath segments by storm ID and expand the data set by adding features based on the increment value of the attribute `Date0`. Earlier dates are threat days
8. Transform the spatial coordinates of the polygons to lat/lon. Call this the modeled hurricane threat, impact, and cleanup (TIC) data

Task 2: Merge the modeled hurricane TIC data with the health outcome (HO) data at the level of individuals. Start with deaths

1. Data file received as a csv file from Jihoon on December 7, 2024 via email
2. Import the health outcome (HO) data. Time period is 1981-1-1 through 2022-12-31.  ~6.2 million deaths (date/location-lat/lon)
3. Make the spreadsheet a point geometry data frame with lat/lon as geographic coordinates
4. Determine dates in the HO data that correspond to dates in the TIC data
5. Determine the deaths occurring within the threat/impact/cleanup polygons. Remove deaths not occurring on threat/impact/cleanup days in Florida. Remove deaths not occurring within the threat/impact/cleanup polygons
6. For each remaining death date assign it to the appropriate threat, impact, cleanup (0: impact, negative integers indicate time before impact, positive integers indicate time after impact)
